<p><b>This is the story of how I learned to stop worrying and love chemicals.<br></b></p>
<p>When last I wrote about my battle of the brush, I was losing, badly, 
to <br>the invasive vines and noxious weeds that had turned forest and field at<br> my Virginia home into an impassable jungle.
 I’d cut them back, but they <br>would return in even greater numbers.<br></p>
<p>So, I consulted far and wide, asking botanists, naturalists, academics<br> and federal and state scientists what to do.
 Buy a Bush Hog? Rent a herd <br>of goats? Move back to the city?<br></p>
<p>One consistent, counterintuitive answer came back: The best thing I can <br>do for nature is to fight the invaders with herbicides.</p>
<p>How could it be that the ecologically sound solution was to apply the<br> same chemicals to my land that Big Agriculture sprays on fields by the<br> tankerful?
 I disdain gardeners who douse every dandelion with<br> Roundup — yet now I was being told that glyphosate,
 the active<br> ingredient in Roundup, is my friend in the fight to save my land.<br></p>
 <h3> “The reliance on herbicides is pretty close to universal,”</h3>

<p>Finally, I checked with Jake Hughes, who is in charge of invasive-plant <br>management for the largest landowner in my neck of the woods,<br>
 Shenandoah National Park<br>.</p>
 <p>Before you accuse me of being a chemical-industry lobbyist, 
 let me<br> assure you that Hughes uses so little of the stuff that Bayer, Roundup’s <br>manufacturer, 
 would go broke if it relied on people like him. For the<br> vast, almost<mark> 200,000-acre park,</mark> he uses an average of just 23 gallons of <br>glyphosate a year,
 diluted and applied surgically to the offending <br>species, usually with backpack sprayers.<br></p>
